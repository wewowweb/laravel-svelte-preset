# Laravel Svelte Preset

A Laravel frontend preset for initial Svelte scaffolding.

## Why?

Svelte is an interesting new approach in the JavaScript space, created by [@Rich_Harris](https://twitter.com/Rich_Harris). While traditional frontend frameworks do the bulk of their work in the browser, Svelte does this in compilation step. They provide a fluid syntax for writing expressive code, but compile it down to small, framework-less vanilla JavaScript.

If you don't know what Svelte is, we highly recommend starting with Rich Harris' talk [Rethinking Reactivity](https://youtu.be/AdNJ3fydeao) from YGLF Code Camp 2019, his [introductory blog post](https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-3-rethinking-reactivity) or - if you're more of a hands-on type - Svelte's [interactive tutorial](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/).

*This package is still in active development, so you might want to [watch](https://github.com/wewowweb/laravel-svelte-preset/subscription) the repository to be notified of future changes.*

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require wewowweb/laravel-svelte-preset
```
After that, run the following command, which will provide you with the initial scaffolding of the project:
```bash
php artisan preset svelte
```
To install the JavaScript dependencies, run:
```bash
npm install && npm run dev
```
The package will provide you with the initial set of files:
 - `/js/app.js`
 - `/js/components/App.svelte` 
 - `webpack.mix.js` 

needed to start developing with Laravel & Svelte.

### Usage

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="{{ str_replace('_', '-', app()->getLocale()) }}">
    <head>
        ...
        <!-- Include the app.js file -->
        <script src="{{ mix('js/app.js') }}" defer></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- Include your App Component -->
        <App />
    </body>
</html>
```

### Registering Custom Svelte Components

Please follow these general conventions when creating your custom components:
 * Component name must be two or more words joined by the '-' character e.g. 'my-test-component'.
 * Components can be accessed in blade file like a regular html tag e.g. `<my-test-component></my-test-component>`
 * Closing tag is necessary because its a web component.

If you wish to register a custom component and use it within your `blade.php` files, you can do it like so: 

#### Step 1: Create a New Custom Component
Let's create a new Svelte Component (e.g. MyTestComponent.svelte)

```html
<script>

</script>

<main>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <div class="col-md-8">
                <div class="card">
                    <div class="card-header">My Test Component</div>
                    <div class="card-body">
                        I'm a test component.
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</main>
```

#### Step 2: Modify The `webpack.mix.js`file

Modifiy the `webpack.mix.js` file like so:

```diff
mix.js('resources/js/app.js', 'public/js')
    .sass('resources/sass/app.scss', 'public/css')
-   .svelte();    
+   .svelte({
+       customElement: true,
+       tag: null
+   });
```
#### Step 3: Import the component to your app.js
Then within your `Ã pp.js` file, import the MyTestComponent like so:

```diff
/**
 * First we will load all of this project's JavaScript dependencies which
 * includes Svelte and other libraries. It is a great starting point when
 * building robust, powerful web applications using Svelte and Laravel.
 */

require('./bootstrap');

import App from "./components/App.svelte";
+ import MyTestComponent from "./components/MyTestComponent.svelte";

const app = new App({
  target: document.body
});

window.app = app;

+ customElements.define('my-test-component', MyTestComponent); 
export default app;
```

#### Step 4: Use the new component in your `blade.php`file

```diff
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="{{ str_replace('_', '-', app()->getLocale()) }}">
    <head>
        ...
        <!-- Include the app.js file -->
        <script src="{{ mix('js/app.js') }}" defer></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- Include your App Component -->
        <App />
+       <my-test-component></my-test-component>
    </body>
</html>
```
